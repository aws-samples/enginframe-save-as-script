## EnginFrame save as script action

<b>The code enables NICE EnginFrame HPC portal services to save themselves as standalone submission scripts.</b><br/>
These scripts can be executed by the user in a later time without accessing the portal, from a command line.

Saving the service as a standalone submission script can cover a number of customer cases, such as:
- Need to submit several instances of the same HPC job manually or within wrapper scripts (e.g. in case of multiple realization jobs)
- Users preferring to submit their jobs from terminals, ssh or DCV sessions
- Build custom jobs workflows and automations, where this submission script becomes a step
- Enable users to work even if the portal is down
- Test/validate job scripts in a quicker way
